# RÂ²-Gaussian Reconstruction â€” Thesis Documentation

This documentation accompanies my Bachelorâ€™s thesis on **3D Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)** reconstruction using the **RÂ²-Gaussian** algorithm.

The **RÂ²-Gaussian** framework was originally proposed by **Zha et al. (2024)** as a *radiative Gaussian splatting* method for tomographic reconstruction.  
In this work, the published algorithm and implementation are **adapted, reproduced, and evaluated** on custom CBCT datasets to:

- test its applicability for preclincal mouse data,
- investigate the influence of hyperparameters such as iteration count, densification thresholds, and total-variation loss,
- compare reconstruction quality (PSNR/SSIM) and computational performance with traditional filtered backprojection (FDK) and iterative algorithms.
