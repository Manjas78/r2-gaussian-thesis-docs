# R²-Gaussian Thesis Docs

This repository hosts the MkDocs-based documentation for my Bachelor's thesis on the **R²-Gaussian cone-beam CT reconstruction algorithm** by Zha et al.

**Live Documentation:**  
https://manjas78.github.io/r2-gaussian-thesis-docs/

The site includes:
- Installation & environment setup  
- Reconstruction pipeline (FDK & R²-Gaussian)  
- Data preparation and evaluation routines  
- Condensed results from phantom, Digimouse, and preclinical datasets  

The documentation is built with **MkDocs + Material Theme** and deployed automatically via **GitHub Pages**.
